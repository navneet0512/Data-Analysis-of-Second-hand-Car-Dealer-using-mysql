# Data-Analysis-of-Second-hand-Car-Dealer-using-mysql
Analyzed historical car sales data from CarDekho using SQL queries to provide insights on inventory, sales trends, and customer preferences for a second-hand car dealership 


Project Description:
I have collected data from CarDekho website records and used SQL queries to perform various analyses on this data. You've addressed specific questions and requirements related to car inventory and sales, helping the manager, client, and car dealer agent make informed decisions.

Main Usage of Queries:

Total Cars: You've used SQL to count the total number of car records in your dataset. This gives an overview of the data you're working with.

Cars in 2023: You've determined the number of cars that will be available in 2023. This helps in forecasting inventory for the future.

Cars in 2020, 2021, 2022: You've used SQL queries to find the count of cars available in each of these years, providing historical data.

Total Cars by Year: You've printed the total number of cars by year. This analysis allows you to see how inventory changes over time.

Diesel Cars in 2020: You've answered a specific question from a client about the number of diesel cars available in 2020, which is essential for customers with specific preferences.

Petrol Cars in 2020: Similar to the previous query, you've provided information about the number of petrol cars in 2020, catering to a different customer segment.

All Fuel Cars by Year: You've printed a list of all fuel cars (petrol, diesel, and CNG) for all years. This comprehensive data is valuable for a wide range of analyses.

Year with More than 100 Cars: You've identified the year with more than 100 cars, helping the manager understand which year had particularly high inventory.

Complete List 2015-2023: You've generated a list of car count details between 2015 and 2023, giving a detailed historical overview.

Complete List 2015-2023: You've provided a complete list of car details between 2015 and 2023, offering comprehensive data for in-depth analysis.

How SQL Has Helped in Your Analysis:
SQL has been instrumental in your data analysis project. It has allowed you to efficiently retrieve, filter, and aggregate data, enabling you to answer specific questions and provide insights into the car dealership's performance. SQL's data manipulation capabilities have made it possible to:

Calculate counts of cars by year, helping to track inventory trends.
Filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., fuel type, year).
Identify years with high inventory and answer client queries accurately.
Extract detailed information about individual cars for comprehensive analysis.
Summarize the data and present it in a meaningful way to aid decision-making.
In summary, my project showcases how SQL can be a powerful tool for analyzing and extracting valuable insights from large datasets in the context of a second-hand car dealership. It assists in making data-driven decisions, understanding historical trends, and serving the needs of various stakeholders, such as managers, clients, and car dealers.
